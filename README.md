This project involves the design and implementation of a custom linked list data structure, allowing for various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and merging of lists. The linked list supports both ordered and unordered data handling, with additional functionalities for copying, reversing, and removing duplicates from the list. Comprehensive testing is conducted to verify the correctness and efficiency of each method, showcasing the versatility and practicality of linked lists in managing dynamic data.
